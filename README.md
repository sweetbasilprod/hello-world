tutorial time babey!


Howdy! I'm Basil, I'm 25, and I go by they/them
I'm super new to coding and developing but I've had an interest in gaming and game creation for a very long time!

I like the color yellow, gardening, cooking, games, horror, and making cool things.
I do produce music as a profession and I've done some soundtracking work, which is always a lot of fun! Feel free to check me out under Atronach's Aura :)

thank u for reading ilu <3
